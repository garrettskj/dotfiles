# Things to do:
#
# handle initramfs.conf:
# compress=xz
#
# handle update-manager.d/update-manager.conf (?)
# prompt=normal
#
# create a kernel clean script
#
# launch tmux with the start of a shell?
# this is difficult, i think we need to determine which ubuntu spin (to start) 
# we are using, then shell the config files.
